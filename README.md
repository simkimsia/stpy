# stpy
Python equivalent of Software Tools in Javascript (henceforth stjs) -- inspired by issue https://github.com/software-tools-in-javascript/stjs/issues/25

## Parts

The progress of this project is documented as a blog at https://simkimsia.github.io/stpy/

This project should be a standalone website as well. Coming soon. The equivalent of how [stjs.tech](https://stjs.tech) is to stjs.
