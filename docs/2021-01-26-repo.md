## 2021-01-26 Repo

I started a GitHub repo for Software Tools in Python (henceforth stpy). You're looking at it now probably. 

All I did was to copy the exact same LICENSE.md used by [Software Tools in Javascript henceforth stjs](https://github.com/software-tools-in-javascript/stjs/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

At the moment, I try to follow the same structure as stjs repository unless I decide otherwise.
